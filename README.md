🚀 **About Me**

👨‍💻 I’m passionate about building reliable, scalable cloud-native infrastructure and automating everything possible.

🔧 I recently deployed a **Strapi CMS application** using AWS ECS Fargate with full Terraform automation and optimized it with Lambda-triggered cleanups.

☸️ I'm also building secure **EKS-based infrastructure** with best practices like IRSA, private subnets, and proper IAM isolation.

📈 I love automating deployment pipelines using **GitHub Actions, CodeDeploy, and Terraform Cloud**.

📫 Currently open to internships and DevOps opportunities where I can help scale infra and grow with the team.
